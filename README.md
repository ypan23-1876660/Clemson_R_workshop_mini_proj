# Clemson_R_workshop_mini_proj
Mini project for Clemson CITI R workshop. 

Objective: Predict if the unknown cell is categorized into "P" or "E" based on gene expression

Explaination: I will be using the data from Mackay-Anholt lab, where the value in the data represents the gene expression of Placentae and Endometrium in cells.
The machine will be trained based on the level of gene expression (high or low) to determine if the cells are Placantae or Endometrium.
The predictand will be the gene expression, and the predictor will be the class "P" for Placentae or "E" for Endometrium.

Output: The output wil be Classification

Result: After validating by the confusion Matrix, where the accuracy is 1, we can conclude that this ML model
